### 1. **Project Overview**
   **Title:** Amazon Sales Analysis â€“ Identifying Key Product Trends and Profitability  
   **Description:**  
   In this Power BI project, I analyzed Amazon sales data from July 2023 using Excel as the primary data source. The analysis focuses on identifying crucial sales trends and profit contributors. A key finding was that 6 products contributed to 60% of the total profits, highlighting the importance of focusing on high-performing products. This project showcases how data analysis can drive strategic decisions that optimize profitability.

### 2. **Tech Stack**

   - **Excel** for storing and cleaning raw sales data.
   - **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions):** Used to calculate total profits, profit percentage by product, and other key metrics.
   - **Power Query** for data transformation and cleaning.

### 3. **Power BI Techniques Learned**
   - **Data Import and Preparation:** Imported and prepared sales data from Excel using Power Query.
   - **Advanced DAX Functions:** Created measures to calculate product-wise profits, overall profit contribution, and profit percentages.
